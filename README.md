rpi-unbird - <sub>With a Raspberry Pi and a speaker you too can discourage nesting and attract hawks!</sub>
----------
Birds often damage property and may pose a health hazard. They are often, rightly, protected and cannot be managed through barbaric means. They can however potentially be managed through their sensitivities and through encouraging their predators and competitors. rpi-unbird utilizes the portable nature of the Raspberry Pi, though any portable, linux device may be used, with an external speaker to play animal sounds which both discourage birds from congregating and encourage natural predators like hawks to patrol the area.

At it's most fundamental level an rpi-unbird device can be considered an electronic game call device/speaker combo. Hunting birds is illegal in many juristictions. Be sure you know the laws in your area.
