rpi-unbird
----------
Birds often damage property and may pose a health hazard. They are often, rightly, protected and cannot be managed through barbaric means. Thay can potentially be managed through their sensitivities and through encouraging their predators and competitors. rpi-unbird utilizes the portable nature of the Raspberry Pi and animal sounds to both discourage birds from congregating and to encourage natural predators like hawks to patrol the area.
